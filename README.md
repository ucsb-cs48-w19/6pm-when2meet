# 6pm-when2meet
Update your `README.md` using the template below. We are specifically interested in the installation instructions (e.g., all the gems, how to load real or seed data, etc.). This sample README was developed for a Rails project, so you can swap the "Gems" section of the "Installation" instructions to include add-ons that are relevant to you.


**Make sure to check out the repo anew (potentially on a loaned laptop) and test your installation instructions.**



Provide a README file with the following information:

# Project Name

## Project summary

### One-sentence description of the project

TODO: A 20-second elevator pitch of your project - its core idea summarized in one sentence.

### Additional information about the project

TODO: Write a compelling/creative/informative project description / summary


## Installation

### Prerequisites

TODO: List what a user needs to have installed before running the installation instructions below (e.g., git, which versions of Ruby/Rails)

### Gems

TODO: List which gems you added to the project, and the purpose each gem serves in your app.

### Installation Steps

TODO: Describe the installation process (making sure you mention `bundle install`).
Instructions need to be such that a user can just copy/paste the commands to get things set up and running. 


## Functionality

TODO: Write usage instructions. Structuring it as a walkthrough can help structure this section,
and showcase your features.


## Known Problems

Provide steps to reproduce the problem and/or name a file or a function where the problem lives.
